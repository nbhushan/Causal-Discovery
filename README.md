# Causal Discovery

Substantive theories in psychology aim to describe causal relation-
ships between variables and graphical causal models are a useful representa-
tion of such relationships. When substantive theories are yet to be developed,
causal search algorithms can be used to explore plausible causal relationships
between variables of interest from observational data. The resulting causal
graphs can then be used to generate substantive hypotheses which can be put
to the test on a new data set. We assess two such procedures which use the
notion of conditional independence to infer underlying causal structures; the
PC algorithm and the LiNGAM algorithm; so-called constraint-based meth-
ods. To validate these procedures, we perform a simulation study varying the
sample size, number of variables, degree of confounding due a latent common
cause, non-normality of the error distribution, and graph sparsity. We score
these procedures using two graph theoretic measures; the structural Hamming
distance, and the structural intervention distance. Results indicate that for
sample sizes typical to psychology, it is hard to separate these methods using
these measures. We further apply these methods on two empirical datasets and
discuss the implications of using such methods as a theory-generating tool in
psychological science.
